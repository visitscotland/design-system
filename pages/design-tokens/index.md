# Design Tokens

Design tokens are master values that contain specific design variables, used to construct and maintain the design while it is constantly evolving.

They are theÂ visual design foundations of our design system and all the values we need, set in data, that can be reused throughout our components.

From colour, spacing, typography, opacity, animation etc, design tokens can represent anything from an RGB colour to a number value or setting a complex box shadow.

Using these instead of hard coded values helps to standardise our designs and ensure we stay consistent whilst the design system grows. It also allows us to have a faster hand-off process between design and UI development.
